## Simple Blockchain Application with Ethereum smart contract

In this application I created a simple blockchain app with ethereum smart contract using solidity.

This is the requirement before I ran the application:
1. Ganache : for develop, deploy and test your dApps.
2. Truffle : Dev framework for build decentralized application (dApps) on the blockchain for etherum network. 
And also for connecting to Ganache.
3. MetaMask : a blockchain wallet.
